## What’s wrong with this picture?

--- code java Swap.java


## What’s different here?

--- code java Swap2.java


## Write `skip`
`skip` takes in an IntList and destructively removes every other IntList node,
starting at the *second* node. (So for example, 1, 2, 3, becomes 1, 3.)  
**Do NOT use recursion.**

## Extra Practice: What does `mystery` do?
Hint: draw box and pointers.
