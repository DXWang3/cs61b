## About readmes

Each subdirectory will contain a `readme.md` and `readme.pdf` that are automatically generated from the `readme.src/readme.src.md` file. Generate the files with:

```shell
cd readme.src
make      # to make just readme.md
# or
make all  # to make readme.md and readme.pdf
```

`readme.pdf` is not included in the default target because generating a PDF from the same source twice will result in nonidentical PDFs, and Git will think changes were made.

`readme.md` is lowercase to make it easy to find among a sea of uppercamelcased `.java` files.
